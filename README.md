# Python Assignment - Tutedude Course

This repository contains my solutions for the first two assignments in the Tutedude Python learning course.

## Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
This script asks the user to input two numbers and performs the following arithmetic operations:
- **Addition**: Adds the two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, handling division by zero.

### How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. It then performs and displays the result of each arithmetic operation.

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This script asks the user to input their first name and last name, then combines these to display a personalized greeting.

### How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name.
2. It then concatenates the first and last names and prints a message like "Hello, [First Name] [Last Name]! Welcome!"

## How to Run the Scripts
To run these scripts:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Use the following commands:
   - `python Task1.py` to run the first script.
   - `python Task2.py` to run the second script.
