# Python Programs: Factorial and Math Module Calculations

This repository contains two Python scripts:

- **Task 1**: Calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.
- **Task 2**: Uses Pythonâ€™s `math` module to perform square root, natural logarithm, and sine calculations based on user input.

---

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation

The script asks the user to input a non-negative integer and then calculates its factorial using a user-defined recursive function. The result is displayed in the console.

**Example Output:**

- Input: 5  
- Output: Factorial of 5 is 120

## Task 2: Math Module Calculations

This script asks the user to input a number and uses the `math` module to calculate:

- Square root
- Natural logarithm
- Sine (in radians)

The results are printed with labels. If the input is negative, the program may raise a `ValueError` for square root and logarithm.

**Example Output:**

- Input: 9  
- Output:  
  - Square root: 3.0  
  - Logarithms: 2.19...  
  - Sine: 0.41...

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

To run the scripts:

```bash
python task1_factorial.py
python task2_math_module.py
