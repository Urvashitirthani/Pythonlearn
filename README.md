Python Assignment - Custom Programs

This repository contains my solutions for two Python programs that take input from the user.

Task 1: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This script calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 and displays the result.

How It Works:

1. The program asks the user to confirm if they want to calculate the sum from 1 to 50.


2. It then computes the sum and prints the result.



Task 2: Odd or Even Number Checker

This script checks if a given number is odd or even based on user input.

How It Works:

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.


2. It checks whether the number is odd or even and displays the result accordingly.



How to Run the Scripts

To run these scripts:

1. Make sure you have Python installed.


2. Open a terminal/command prompt.


3. Use the following commands to run each script:

python sum_1_to_50.py

python odd_or_even.py




Feedback and Contributions

Feel free to open a pull request if you have suggestions for improving the code or adding new features!wing commands:
   - `python Task1.py` to run the first script.
